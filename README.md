**About Me and My Project**
My name is** M. Daniyal Ismail**, and I am a GIAIC student. I was assigned Template No. 1 for this project. I submitted Hackathon 2 with a late submission due to university project deadlines, but I have now almost completed Hackathon 2 and Hackathon 3. The only remaining tasks are:

Add to cart functionality

Shipment API integration

Checkout with Stripe

Testing report

These tasks require time, and my goal is to complete them in the near future, Inshallah. With guidance from my student leaders, I decided to submit my repository and website for the Hackathon. The reason for the delay is that I have my university final exams in the upcoming week, which limits my ability to complete the remaining tasks within the given deadline.

**What Iâ€™ve Accomplished:**
Template Replication: I successfully replicated Template 1 with full responsiveness.

**Hackathon 3 Progress:**

**Day 1 & Day 2:** Prepared and submitted documentation in the documentation folder of my repository.

**Day 3: **Integrated Sanity, migrated data, and connected it with the API.

**Day 4: **Implemented dynamic routing for every page, product listing, product details page, pagination, filters, breadcrumbs, and quantity increase/decrease functionality using useState. I also added functional logic for increasing/decreasing prices, calculating checkout totals, and applying discounts.

Added animations and hover effects to buttons and other elements to make the website minimalistic and aesthetic.

**Acknowledgments:**
I want to thank all the teachers, student leaders, and my peers for their support and guidance throughout this journey. The knowledge I gained from physical classes, recorded lectures, WhatsApp groups, and Discord channels has been invaluable. Special thanks to everyone who provided light and direction during this challenging yet rewarding quarter.
