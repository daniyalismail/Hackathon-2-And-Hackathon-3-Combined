📖 About Me and My Project
Hello! My name is M. Daniyal Ismail, and I am a GIAIC student. I was assigned Template No. 1 for this project. I submitted Hackathon 2 with a late submission due to university project deadlines, but I have now almost completed Hackathon 2 and Hackathon 3. Here’s a summary of my progress and remaining tasks:

🚧 Remaining Tasks
Add to Cart Functionality

Shipment API Integration

Checkout with Stripe

Testing Report

These tasks require time, and my goal is to complete them in the near future, Inshallah. With guidance from my student leaders, I decided to submit my repository and website for the Hackathon. The reason for the delay is that I have my university final exams in the upcoming week, which limits my ability to complete the remaining tasks within the given deadline.

🏆 What I’ve Accomplished
Template Replication
Successfully replicated Template 1 with full responsiveness.

Hackathon 3 Progress
Day 1 & Day 2: Prepared and submitted documentation in the documentation folder of my repository.

Day 3: Integrated Sanity, migrated data, and connected it with the API.

Day 4: Implemented the following features:

Dynamic Routing for every page.

Product Listing and Product Details Page.

Pagination, Filters, and Breadcrumbs.

Quantity Increase/Decrease functionality using useState.

Functional logic for increasing/decreasing prices, calculating checkout totals, and applying discounts.

Added animations and hover effects to buttons and other elements to make the website minimalistic and aesthetic.
